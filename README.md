# mousetrails
A Python script to keep your mouse moving in a random way. 

This simple Python script can be used to move your mouse randomly around the screen. You can adjust the speed and interval of the moves. 

Why would you want something like this? 

Some use cases:
  - Educational, learn how to control the mouse via code.
  - Watch the mouse move around as a form of therapy.
  - Your own old school DVD logo but with the mouse.
  - Keep your mouse moving more randomly to keep snooping employers from tracking your work.
  - Keep your screen alive if you step away from your computer.
